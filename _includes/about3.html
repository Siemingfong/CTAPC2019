<p>2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
</p>

<p>Blockchain has been proposed as a system for enabling various entities to contribute into maintaining a common ledger of a digital history with little friction and seamless circulation.</p>
<p>The development and deployment of Blockchain-based systems, and their applications, need to take into consideration new requirements and challenges, thereby raising novel open issues and research themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and engineering improvements to the protocols and architectures underpinning Distributed Ledger Technologies (including Blockchains).</li>
<li>The convergence of the technology with other emerging technologies (e.g., AI, IoT) that are becoming key elements of the fourth industrial revolution.</li>
<li>Gaining insights of the technical, business, legal, and societal implications of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, including real-life applications and case studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>List of Topics (Indicative list, other related topics will also be considered):</p>
<ul>
<li>Coronavirus Technology</li>
<li>Virtual Assistant</li>
<li>Dialog System</li>
<li>Industry 4.0 transformation and Blockchains</li>
