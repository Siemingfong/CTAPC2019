 - {title: "Chain", image: "chain.jpg", text: "Blockchain is bringing about a major transformation in the financial sector. It is a global phenomenon â€” in fact banks and fintech companies in India are applying a test and scale approach to blockchain technology in a controlled environment." }
 - {title: "Token", image: "token.jpg", text: "Ethereum has already established itself as the most popular DApp platform, attracting massive amounts of developers thanks to its support for an easy-to-use programming language, Solidity, as well as a bevy of ICOs with ERC-20 tokens. It also boasts the most functional use cases of any crypto project in history, with more DApps coming to its mainnet each week." }
 - {title: "AI", image: "ai.jpg", text: "AI can introduce even new decentralised learning systems such as federated learning or new data sharing techniques that make the system much more efficient." }
